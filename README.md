# Welcome to Coin Data School

A place where you get data-driven insights about DeFi and NFT projects and learn how to analyze crypto data.

I’m a data scientist and statistician. I’m also a DeFi user and crypto researcher. I spend most of my waking hours analyzing crypto data and building open source tools that help you make smarter decisions. I share my findings in a free [newsletter](https://coindataschool.substack.com/). 
You can also find me on [dune](https://dune.com/coindataschool) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/coindataschool).
